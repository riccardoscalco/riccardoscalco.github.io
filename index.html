				<h2>
					Who I am
				</h2>
				<p>
					Hard to say. To be honest, I suspect there is something odd with the verb <em>to be</em>. I ended up thinking that <em>I am what I do</em> &mdash; this way of thinking keeps me motivated to do things that <em>make me feel well</em>.

				<h2>A pressing nightmare in front of me</h2>
				<p>I spend delightful hours reading about philosophy and physics. I am fascinated by how scientific knowledge evolves. This interest pushes me along a path in the landscape of the history of physics and epistemology. Why all of this? I think because I have the same nightmare that Ludwig Boltzmann had.</p>
				<figure>
					<blockquote cite="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20118168?seq=1">
						<p>
							I always feel a pressing nightmare that it is a puzzle that I am alive at all. Likewise the existence of the world is a puzzle, and that the world is exactly as it is. A science which could resolve these puzzles would become a genuine queen and its name would be philosophy.
						</p>
						<p>
							—Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann

					<h2>History of Physics</h2>
					<p>A showcase of iconic moments in physics.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					I have embarked on a personal project that truly captivates me. This project entails meticulously recreating the intricate graphs or drawings that, in a groundbreaking turn of events in physics, paved the way for novel ideas and discoveries. Moreover, in the course of this research, a fascinating narrative unfolds, shedding light on the human aspect behind these pivotal moments in history. The exploration of these milestones reveals captivating anecdotes and the profound emotional nuances inherent in the pursuit of scientific breakthroughs.

					<h2>The birth of quanta</h2>
					<!-- <p>Planck, October 1900</p> -->
				</header>
				<p>
					Sunday <strong>7 October 1900</strong> Rubens together with his wife visited Planck, the discussion turned to the measurements with which Rubens was occupied. Rubens said that for the longest wave-lengths &mdash; which he could achieve &mdash; the law recently proposed by Lord Rayleigh was valid. On receiving this information from Rubens, Planck set down and studied the theoretical implications for the equilibrium entropy, deriving the radiation formula that carries his name.
					<small>The text has been adapted from the book <em><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780387952628">The Historical Development of Quantum Theory. Vol. 1.</a></em> by Mehra and Rechenberg.</small>
				</p>
				<p>
					The same evening Planck reported the formula to Rubens on a postcard, which the latter received the following morning. One or two day later Rubens went to Planck, and was able to bring him the news that the new formula agreed perfectly with his observations.
					<small>Plank published his formula on paper <em><a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-663-13885-3_15">Über eine Verbesserung der Wienschen Spektralgleichung</a></em> the next <strong>19 October</strong>.</small>

Rubens and F. Kurlbaum, published in <em>Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin</em> on <strong>25 October 1900</strong> (english translation provided by the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1901ApJ....14..335R/abstract">Astrophysical Journal</a>). Note that Planck proposed his formula on 19 October 1900. Rubens and Kurlbaum discussed (and praised) Planck's formula in their paper, but they added it to the figures only in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/andp.19013090402">successive paper</a> on 1901.

				<h2>Generative Art</h2>
				<p>
					Generative art forces me to create something <em>deliberately useless</em> &mdash; which is quite ambitious for me.
					I live art as an act of research… maybe of elegance, or surprise, or happiness. I particularly like <em>meaningless</em> art: it does not convey any message, it is just a way to look inside myself.

					<h2>Gaussian Curvature</h2>
					<p>An excursion through discrete differential geometry.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					Recently I worked on the implementation of two-dimensional surfaces embedded in a 3D space. With the occasion, I wanted to explore the concept of <em>intrinsic curvature</em>, as studied by Gauss first and Riemann later. To calculate the Gaussian curvature in the vertex shader I used the definition given by Meyer et al. in <em>Discrete Differential-Geometry Operators for Triangulated 2-Manifolds</em>. Have a look at the code implementation in
					<a class="external" href="https://observablehq.com/@riccardoscalco/gaussian-curvature">Observable</a>.
